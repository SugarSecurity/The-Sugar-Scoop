# Sugar Security Scoop 1 - Trust and Anti-Trust

## The Year is 2016...







## Anti-Trust Congress July 29th 2020

Coronavirus pandemic has infected over 4 million americans and killed over 150k.

The US Economy has grinded to a halt

But these 4 companies are booming, and are worth over $5 Trillion combined - an unprecedented amount

Amazon = 70% of online Sales
- Plus Small Biz Lending, Transportation, Movies, etc
Apple = Services, Apps, Games, 

Facebook = Super Hacked, Control communications fow how many? Ads, Marketplace

Google = Online Ads, foundation, android OS on EVERYTHING (voting machines)

All 4 = >5 Trilli, meanwhile small biz is crashing. Too much power over our information and economy and they are killing manufacturing, entrepreneurship, and other foundations of the economy. Because of these, it is impossible for the consumer to escape, no other options. 

Cicciline says he feels it is non partisan

First major tech investigation

We will see.....
