# Sugar Security Scoop 1 - Trust and Anti-Trust

As a cybersecurity and tech CEO, I think abouit the concepts of trust a lot. Many of the smartest people I work with are pursuing ways to make things like encryption work with "Zero Trust", and now I have the oppurtunity to view an ANTI-trust congressional hearing. Interesting...

One major point that a reporter made earlier is that these men are often never speaking, unscripted, before a public forum. Opening statements will be clean but I cant wait for things to deteriorate.

## The Year is 2016...

## Anti-Trust Congress July 29th 2020

Coronavirus pandemic has infected over 4 million americans and killed over 150k.

The US Economy has grinded to a halt

But these 4 companies are booming, and are worth over $5 Trillion combined - an unprecedented amount

## The Companies 

All 4 = >5 Trilli, meanwhile small biz is crashing. Too much power over our information and economy and they are killing manufacturing, entrepreneurship, and other foundations of the economy. Because of these, it is impossible for the consumer to escape, no other options. 

### Amazon
70% of online Sales

Plus Small Biz Lending, Transportation, Movies, etc

### Apple
Services, Apps, Games, 

### Facebook
Super Hacked, Control communications fow how many? Ads, Marketplace

### Google
Online Ads, foundation, android OS on EVERYTHING (voting machines)




## Initial Statements from the CEOs

Each of the tech CEOs gets 5 minutes and of course they're all going to use the entire 5 minutes exactly. 

### Jeff Bezos, Amazon

Ethos followed by Pathos. Born from a working class, American Dream, wants to cooperate, etc. Logos = "but we are only 1% of global retail market!"

## Sundar Pichai, Google

Same sort of speech as Bezos. "We make cheap phones for poor people, we donate to charity". Virtue signaling and rhetoric. That's all these CEOs do. They know how to talk nice, but I don't think it will fly among the congressional committe. We will see

## Tim Cook, Apple
Starts with an in memorium for some guy. Wow, see what I mean? Then tells his story


## Key Subcomittee / Congressional Members
Chair of the Subcomittee = Cicciline(?spelling?)

Sensenbrenner

Cicciline says he feels it is non partisan

Everyone took the work seriously and studied carefully

American democratic system HATES monopolies and has investigated energy, auto, etc

First major tech investigation

We will see.....

## Specific Laws
Anti-trust

Consumer Welfare Standard
- Been around for over a century protecting free market


# Questions
## From Cicilline to Google
Consistent reports that Google steals ideas from small businesses, redirects users to profitable-for-Google sites and services instead of the objectively best service. Sundhar denies. Sundhar says $100B+ revenue from redirecting users to other stuff? Google has grown from small turnstile to a gatekeeper of commcerce and knowledge. This includes shutting down news sites. Google threatened to shut down Yelp! Chairman basically says regardless of fancy talk from CEO, it is clear when you look at the history and numbers that Google is essentially a "Walled Garden" for commerce in the united states. 

## From Sensenbrenner to Zuckerberg
Concerned that people that manage "the net" are using their control to affect political discourse. Asks Zuckerberg specific policies on handling political data.

Zuckerberg says he wants to give everyone a voice and platform. Day to day stuff, politics, etc. He says he controls this VERY little. Obvious standards like racism, terrorism, child exploitation, yadda yadda stalling for time so he doesn't have to answer the actual question. Cut off by congressman saying answer the question! Facebook removed Trump stuff very recently related to Medicine. Wait that was on Twitter.... Zuckerberg says they dont endorse experimental drugs. 

## Naddler to Zuck
Naddler is the chair of the whole judiciary committee. Says Facebook buying insta was bad. Zuckerberg says no, nobody really thought of pictures-only as a social network. My theory is that Zuckerberg saw the dollar signs speaking and wanted it. Plus things like GPS and Facial Recognition data  but thats a personal opinion. Naddler replies that Zuckerberg ON-RECORD says that Instagram was a disruptive threat that could hurt Facebook. Zuckerberg again stalls for time saying thank you for asking this question and yadda yadda gets cut off by Naddler who again brings up a record stating that Zuckerberg wanted to buy Instagram to neutralize a competitor. Zuckerberg and Naddler go back and forth. Naddler brings up another yes/no and gets stalled by Zuck. Says he's working on security and things and stuff. Naddler wraps up and says he specifically bought Instagram to shut down competition which is against anti-trust laws. 

## From Colorado, Mr Buck 
Appeal to conservative capitalism, says F fascism and commies, we went to the moon. No I am not joking thats really how he started. Badass. 

Mr. Buck says because of America these CEOs have had the freedom to succeed like they have. References the Pentagon Cloud JEDI contract (link here later) and a report that Google manipulated the JEDI contract to the benefit of communist China. Google stood to gain from this by Chinese factory workers helping build chips for devices that would then be used to track Americans and commit further espionage for China. 

Google has also taken advantage of other companies and their data (Look @ Google Lyrics stealing Genius Lyrics) and the many companies and conservative charities and books that rank lower than others despite being a better fit for the results. Very long question and a lot to address, but Buck asks "Do you think you could make as much money from commie china if you weren't a monopoly?". Seems like a clearly loaded question in my opinion so I can't really fault Google for their nonsense answer to a nonsense question. 

## From Hank Johnson to Tim Cook @ Apple
Apple is the sole decision maker on who can access what software, which is critical to business operations. Tim Cook makes a good point that third party web apps can be used without the app store but your mileage may vary. Hank Johnson fires back and says that Apple regularly makes huge terms of service changes that can shut down apps and businesses and developers (especially competitors) for the benefit of Apple. Tim Johnson denies and says that all App Store users and developers are treated equally, there is no favor. Johnson says no here is a couple examples - Baidu has 2 employees assigned to navigate App Store beaurocracy and Apple additionally requires apple developers to pay for the ability to make apps on their huge platform and put all payments through their system which takes a % out. 

Tim Cook says the commission is small and they would never increase commission but Hank says BS. 

## From Gates to All of Them
Gives CEOs the oppurtunity to state whether or not they support American values... interesting. 

Ah, it was bait for Google. There was a previous statement from Google that they would withdraw from the JEDI contract because they don't support the military. Sort of...

Roasted? Google also has stated that they provide services that support police and ambulance and such so congress wants to know if they will revoke / charge extra to the government for example. Sundhar says there is no history of them doing that, but was sort of Cagey. Google has a Chinese AI center and supports the chinese military but withdraws from US military projects. No JEDI, no Project Maven, but sure let's get a team on improving Chinese fighter jets. Google CEO says that is a lie, we don't work with chinese military. Maybe they are using an open source project but thats it. 

## From Baskin to ?? - His mic is off - Zuckerberg
Brings up Cambridge Analytica. They did pro-Russia and anti-USA research that was powered by Facebook. Does Zuckerberg see it as something they need to address, or is that just the cost of business? Zuckerberg throws some numbers - they have donated X dollars and have Y employees working on cybersecurity, election system development, 89% of hate speech removed? Missed that number --- gets cut off by Baskin. What about the 6.5 billion FAKE accounts that 1. cause political problems and 2. are profitable to facebook's numbers. Zuck says he knows those things are damaging to society AND to their platform.

## Intermission
There was a technical problem with someone so they are taking an intermission. I didn't notice anything. Everyone is masked for COVID.It's 2:38 Eastern time and while writing this I have also gotten the attention of some friends who want to watch and help report. Awesome. Let's talk about Zero Trust and Anti-Trust more. 

### Zero Trust
If you Google (ha) Zero Trust, you will see a lot of results from major tech / cybersecurity companies blogging about how their security model incorporates the concept of Zero Trust. Of course the first and biggest result is from CloudFlare which has a partnership with Google, What does that mean though? 

###TODO COME BACK TO THIS LATER

## we're back. Mr. Armstrong to Google
Does Google's market control around advertising and analytics is big. Possibly so big and out of control that it is non-compliant with GDPR. Google may be refusing to disclose how they advertise and track users?  Sundhar @ Google says he doesn't believe there is anything there.
