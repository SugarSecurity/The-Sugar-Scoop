# Sugar Security Scoop 1 - Trust and Anti-Trust

As a cybersecurity and tech CEO, I think abouit the concepts of trust a lot. Many of the smartest people I work with are pursuing ways to make things like encryption work with "Zero Trust", and now I have the oppurtunity to view an ANTI-trust congressional hearing. Interesting...

One major point that a reporter made earlier is that these men are often never speaking, unscripted, before a public forum. Opening statements will be clean but I cant wait for things to deteriorate.

## Anti-Trust Congress July 29th 2020

Coronavirus pandemic has infected over 4 million americans and killed over 150k.

The US Economy has grinded to a halt

But these 4 companies are booming, and are worth over $5 Trillion combined - an unprecedented amount

## The Companies 

All 4 = >5 Trilli, meanwhile small biz is crashing. Too much power over our information and economy and they are killing manufacturing, entrepreneurship, and other foundations of the economy. Because of these, it is impossible for the consumer to escape, no other options. 

### Amazon
70% of online Sales

Plus Small Biz Lending, Transportation, Movies, etc

### Apple
Services, Apps, Games, 

### Facebook
Super Hacked, Control communications fow how many? Ads, Marketplace

### Google
Online Ads, foundation, android OS on EVERYTHING (voting machines)




## Initial Statements from the CEOs

Each of the tech CEOs gets 5 minutes and of course they're all going to use the entire 5 minutes exactly. 

### Jeff Bezos, Amazon

Ethos followed by Pathos. Born from a working class, American Dream, wants to cooperate, etc. Logos = "but we are only 1% of global retail market!"

## Sundar Pichai, Google

Same sort of speech as Bezos. "We make cheap phones for poor people, we donate to charity". Virtue signaling and rhetoric. That's all these CEOs do. They know how to talk nice, but I don't think it will fly among the congressional committe. We will see

## Tim Cook, Apple
Starts with an in memorium for some guy. Wow, see what I mean? Then tells his story


## Key Subcomittee / Congressional Members
Chair of the Subcomittee = Cicciline(?spelling?)

Sensenbrenner

Cicciline says he feels it is non partisan

Everyone took the work seriously and studied carefully

American democratic system HATES monopolies and has investigated energy, auto, etc

First major tech investigation

We will see.....

## Specific Laws
Anti-trust

Consumer Welfare Standard
- Been around for over a century protecting free market


# Questions
## From Cicilline to Google
Consistent reports that Google steals ideas from small businesses, redirects users to profitable-for-Google sites and services instead of the objectively best service. Sundhar denies. Sundhar says $100B+ revenue from redirecting users to other stuff? Google has grown from small turnstile to a gatekeeper of commcerce and knowledge. This includes shutting down news sites. Google threatened to shut down Yelp! Chairman basically says regardless of fancy talk from CEO, it is clear when you look at the history and numbers that Google is essentially a "Walled Garden" for commerce in the united states. 

## From Sensenbrenner to Zuckerberg
Concerned that people that manage "the net" are using their control to affect political discourse. Asks Zuckerberg specific policies on handling political data.

Zuckerberg says he wants to give everyone a voice and platform. Day to day stuff, politics, etc. He says he controls this VERY little. Obvious standards like racism, terrorism, child exploitation, yadda yadda stalling for time so he doesn't have to answer the actual question. Cut off by congressman saying answer the question! Facebook removed Trump stuff very recently related to Medicine. Wait that was on Twitter.... Zuckerberg says they dont endorse experimental drugs. 

## Naddler to Zuck
Naddler is the chair of the whole judiciary committee. Says Facebook buying insta was bad. Zuckerberg says no, nobody really thought of pictures-only as a social network. My theory is that Zuckerberg saw the dollar signs speaking and wanted it. Plus things like GPS and Facial Recognition data  but thats a personal opinion. Naddler replies that Zuckerberg ON-RECORD says that Instagram was a disruptive threat that could hurt Facebook. Zuckerberg again stalls for time saying thank you for asking this question and yadda yadda gets cut off by Naddler who again brings up a record stating that Zuckerberg wanted to buy Instagram to neutralize a competitor.
