## Google Associate Cloud Engineer Takeover
Recently, I was reading the (Official Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide)[https://www.amazon.com/Google-Cloud-Certified-Associate-Engineer/dp/1119564417/] by Dan Sullivan. 

Throughout the book, the author provides examples of how a cloud engineer might configure Google services such as Google Cloud Storage or App Engine. These examples often include "theoretical" domain names that, when viewed in e-book form, create clickable hyperlinks.
