# Sugar Security Scoop 1 - Trust, Trusts, and Anti-Trust
On Wednesday July 28th, 2020, the CEOs of [The Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech#Big_Four) (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google) were called to testify before the U.S House of Representatives regarding accusations of monopolistic business practices.  This article was journaled live during the hearing and an introduction was edited in later.

> "To assume the best about another is the trait that has created modern society. Those occasions when our trusting nature gets violated are tragic. But the alternative - to abandon trust as a defense against predation and deception - is worse.”

## Trust

A central concept in information security is trust. As Malcom Gladwell explains above, most of the foundations of human society are based on trust. We trust banks with our money, doctors with our health, teachers with our children, and restaurants with our food. The very core of humanity demands trust in families, friendship, and commerce. 

Trust can unfortunately be violated. The cyberecurity community is working on ways to fix broken trust with concepts like Blockchain and Zero Trust but these aren't perfect either. 

When designing a (website, company, school, country) you don't want to *assume the best* in people 24/7. We should all have a healthy level of suspicion. In infosec your *Product/Thing* should limit **absolute bare minimum** access to those who **absolutely need it**.

## Trusts

[The Business Dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/trust.html) defines *trust* (noun) as:

> a legal entity created by a party (the trustor) through which a second party (the trustee) holds the right to manage the trustor's assets or property for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary).

## Wait don't go! No more definitions - trust us...

A trust is a combination of companies and people that are allowed to manage things like houses, restaurants, or companies. This allows for things like boards of directors and property managers. **Trusts** require a lot of **trust** and without those we wouldn't have *critical foundations of modern society* like [U.S Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Steel) or [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)). 

## Anti-Trust

> The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered

> - **The Tao Te Ching**

**JP Morgan** was born very wealthy and married even wealthier. He got a job in banking and invested other people's money in land and gold. He sold the gold to the government during a depression for massive piles of cash. Morgan used his unprecedented wealth to buy up what he saw to be the critical infrastructure for the next century. Railroads, steel, and oil companies were all put under his umbrella into modern institutions like General Electric, U.S. Steel, and Chase Bank.

Where would we be without Mr. Morgan and his rapid expansion? Maybe things would be better today, maybe they would be worse. American capitalism generally trusts that the negatives of human progress (tanks and nukes) are outweighed by the positives (trains and Netflix). 

# House Anti-Trust Hearing - July 29th 2020 - Recorded Live

It's Summer 2020 and the Coronavirus pandemic is in full swing. The US Economy has grinded to a halt for the most part. Tech companies are doing better than ever. 

These companies and their respective CEOs are being accused of abusing **Trusts** in order to profit. Small collectives of people managing our food, the ingredients for the food, the advertisements for the food, the things you search about food, and the device you're submitting food orders through. Nearly 25% of the US economy is stuck in a loop, making the rich richer. 

Congress also accuses The Big Four of abusing **Trust** in order to profit. Trust from the government and the people that these companies and their leaders will behave and conduct business ethically. That the platforms and data the companies control will be as secure as they claim. For example, that Google won't suddenly start hiking prices for a "critical" services like Google Maps.
