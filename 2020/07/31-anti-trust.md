# Sugar Security Scoop 1 - Trust, Trusts, and Anti-Trust

> “To assume the best about another is the trait that has created modern society. Those occasions when our trusting nature gets violated are tragic. But the alternative - to abandon trust as a defense against predation and deception - is worse.”
> 
> - **Malcolm Gladwell, Talking to Strangers**

## Trust

In Cybersecurity, we are always thinking about the concept of trust. As Mr. Gladwell explains above, for modern society to have things like banks, medical care, and restaurants, a lot of **trust** is required. This concept extends to the very core of humanity in things like family and friendship. 

Trust can also be horrendously violated.

When designing a (network, website, mobile app, etc.) you never want to *assume the best* in people, or in your systems. Instead, your *product/thing* should only give out the **absolute bare minimum** level of access that is **absolutely necessary**.

"Zero-trust" systems are buzzing.

## Trusts

[The Business Dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/trust.html) defines *trust* (noun) as:

> a legal entity created by a party (the trustor) through which a second party (the trustee) holds the right to manage the trustor's assets or property for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary).

# WAIT KEEP READING - no more legal definitions I swear

A trust is a combination of companies and people that are allowed to manage things like houses, restaurants, or companies. **Trusts** require a lot of **trust** and without those we wouldn't have *critical foundations of modern life* like [U.S Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Steel) or [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)). 

## Anti-Trust

> The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered 
>
> - **The Tao Te Ching**

Anti-trust is just as important as trust. 

**JP Morgan** was born very wealthy and married even wealthier. He got a job in banking and invested other people's money in land and gold. He sold the gold to the government during a depression for massive piles of cash. Morgan used his unprecedented wealth to buy up what he saw to be the critical infrastructure for the next century. Railroads, steel, and oil companies were all put under his umbrella into modern institutions like General Electric, U.S. Steel, and Chase Bank.

Where would we be without Mr. Morgan and his rapid expansion? Maybe things would be better today, maybe they would be worse. You can weigh trains and netflix vs tanks and nukes.

# House Anti-Trust Hearing - July 29th 2020 - Recorded Live

We're in the same sort of spot today. Coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 4 million americans and killed over 150k. The US Economy has grinded to a halt.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are booming. These four companies are worth over five trillion dollars combined.



How did they get there? They revolutionized commerce, advertising, entertainment, and human connection. They were early players who played hard and got 

### Amazon
70% of online Sales

Plus Small Biz Lending, Transportation, Movies, etc

### Apple
Services, Apps, Games, 

### Facebook
Super Hacked, Control communications fow how many? Ads, Marketplace

### Google
Online Ads, foundation, android OS on EVERYTHING (voting machines)


Only Zuckerberg has spoken to Congress before (regarding data security and privacy) and most of these CEOs avoid public forums entirely. 


## Initial Statements from the CEOs

Each of the tech CEOs gets 5 minutes and of course they're all going to use the entire 5 minutes exactly. 

### Jeff Bezos, Amazon

Ethos followed by Pathos. Born from a working class, American Dream, wants to cooperate, etc. Logos = "but we are only 1% of global retail market!"

### Sundar Pichai, Google

Same sort of speech as Bezos. "We make cheap phones for poor people, we donate to charity". Virtue signaling and rhetoric. That's all these CEOs do. They know how to talk nice, but I don't think it will fly among the congressional committe. We will see

### Tim Cook, Apple
Starts with an in memorium for some guy. Wow, see what I mean? Then tells his story


## Key Subcomittee / Congressional Members
Chair of the Subcomittee = Cicciline(?spelling?)

Sensenbrenner

Cicciline says he feels it is non partisan

Everyone took the work seriously and studied carefully

American democratic system HATES monopolies and has investigated energy, auto, etc

First major tech investigation

We will see.....

## Specific Laws
Anti-trust

Consumer Welfare Standard
- Been around for over a century protecting free market


# Questions
## From Cicilline to Google
Consistent reports that Google steals ideas from small businesses, redirects users to profitable-for-Google sites and services instead of the objectively best service. Sundhar denies. Sundhar says $100B+ revenue from redirecting users to other stuff? Google has grown from small turnstile to a gatekeeper of commcerce and knowledge. This includes shutting down news sites. Google threatened to shut down Yelp! Chairman basically says regardless of fancy talk from CEO, it is clear when you look at the history and numbers that Google is essentially a "Walled Garden" for commerce in the united states. 

## From Sensenbrenner to Zuckerberg
Concerned that people that manage "the net" are using their control to affect political discourse. Asks Zuckerberg specific policies on handling political data.

Zuckerberg says he wants to give everyone a voice and platform. Day to day stuff, politics, etc. He says he controls this VERY little. Obvious standards like racism, terrorism, child exploitation, yadda yadda stalling for time so he doesn't have to answer the actual question. Cut off by congressman saying answer the question! Facebook removed Trump stuff very recently related to Medicine. Wait that was on Twitter.... Zuckerberg says they dont endorse experimental drugs. 

## Naddler to Zuck
Naddler is the chair of the whole judiciary committee. Says Facebook buying insta was bad. Zuckerberg says no, nobody really thought of pictures-only as a social network. My theory is that Zuckerberg saw the dollar signs speaking and wanted it. Plus things like GPS and Facial Recognition data  but thats a personal opinion. Naddler replies that Zuckerberg ON-RECORD says that Instagram was a disruptive threat that could hurt Facebook. Zuckerberg again stalls for time saying thank you for asking this question and yadda yadda gets cut off by Naddler who again brings up a record stating that Zuckerberg wanted to buy Instagram to neutralize a competitor. Zuckerberg and Naddler go back and forth. Naddler brings up another yes/no and gets stalled by Zuck. Says he's working on security and things and stuff. Naddler wraps up and says he specifically bought Instagram to shut down competition which is against anti-trust laws. 

## From Colorado, Mr Buck 
Appeal to conservative capitalism, says F fascism and commies, we went to the moon. No I am not joking thats really how he started. Badass. 

Mr. Buck says because of America these CEOs have had the freedom to succeed like they have. References the Pentagon Cloud JEDI contract (link here later) and a report that Google manipulated the JEDI contract to the benefit of communist China. Google stood to gain from this by Chinese factory workers helping build chips for devices that would then be used to track Americans and commit further espionage for China. 

Google has also taken advantage of other companies and their data (Look @ Google Lyrics stealing Genius Lyrics) and the many companies and conservative charities and books that rank lower than others despite being a better fit for the results. Very long question and a lot to address, but Buck asks "Do you think you could make as much money from commie china if you weren't a monopoly?". Seems like a clearly loaded question in my opinion so I can't really fault Google for their nonsense answer to a nonsense question. 

## From Hank Johnson to Tim Cook @ Apple
Apple is the sole decision maker on who can access what software, which is critical to business operations. Tim Cook makes a good point that third party web apps can be used without the app store but your mileage may vary. Hank Johnson fires back and says that Apple regularly makes huge terms of service changes that can shut down apps and businesses and developers (especially competitors) for the benefit of Apple. Tim Johnson denies and says that all App Store users and developers are treated equally, there is no favor. Johnson says no here is a couple examples - Baidu has 2 employees assigned to navigate App Store beaurocracy and Apple additionally requires apple developers to pay for the ability to make apps on their huge platform and put all payments through their system which takes a % out. 

Tim Cook says the commission is small and they would never increase commission but Hank says BS. 

## From Gates to All of Them
Gives CEOs the oppurtunity to state whether or not they support American values... interesting. 

Ah, it was bait for Google. There was a previous statement from Google that they would withdraw from the JEDI contract because they don't support the military. Sort of...

Roasted? Google also has stated that they provide services that support police and ambulance and such so congress wants to know if they will revoke / charge extra to the government for example. Sundhar says there is no history of them doing that, but was sort of Cagey. Google has a Chinese AI center and supports the chinese military but withdraws from US military projects. No JEDI, no Project Maven, but sure let's get a team on improving Chinese fighter jets. Google CEO says that is a lie, we don't work with chinese military. Maybe they are using an open source project but thats it. 

## From Baskin to ?? - His mic is off - Zuckerberg
Brings up Cambridge Analytica. They did pro-Russia and anti-USA research that was powered by Facebook. Does Zuckerberg see it as something they need to address, or is that just the cost of business? Zuckerberg throws some numbers - they have donated X dollars and have Y employees working on cybersecurity, election system development, 89% of hate speech removed? Missed that number --- gets cut off by Baskin. What about the 6.5 billion FAKE accounts that 1. cause political problems and 2. are profitable to facebook's numbers. Zuck says he knows those things are damaging to society AND to their platform.

## Intermission
There was a technical problem with someone so they are taking an intermission. I didn't notice anything. Everyone is masked for COVID.It's 2:38 Eastern time and while writing this I have also gotten the attention of some friends who want to watch and help report. Awesome. Let's talk about Zero Trust and Anti-Trust more. 

### Zero Trust
If you Google (ha) Zero Trust, you will see a lot of results from major tech / cybersecurity companies blogging about how their security model incorporates the concept of Zero Trust. Of course the first and biggest result is from CloudFlare which has a partnership with Google, What does that mean though? 

### TODO COME BACK TO THIS LATER

## we're back. Mr. Armstrong to Google
Does Google's market control around advertising and analytics is big. Possibly so big and out of control that it is non-compliant with GDPR. Google may be refusing to disclose how they advertise and track users?  Sundhar @ Google says he doesn't believe there is anything there. Armstrong also expresses concerns with geofencing and GPS tracking with things like Fitbit, GoPro, etc. being sold to China. Congressman asks if Google's data should be public record though? I don't think so... sort of a weird question. 

### It has been an hour and no questions for Bezos yet... I am watching this video on a Washington Post live stream which is also owned by Bezos. 

## Speak of the Devil! To Bezos from Jayapal
does Amazon access data for third party sales, split competitors into very small categories to shrink them, do they enforce data policies? Bezos video cut out when Jayapal follows up? Bezos is back, says that aggregate data from large numbers of third party sellers allow them to get large amounts of consumer and business data. Sales reports, product reports, inventory, reviews, advertising costs, unit costs, shipping costs, and then Amazon will use that data to launch a competitor. Whoa.

Bezos of course responds with "thank you for the oppurtunity to answer this questions yadda yadda," Jayapal says that her time is expiring and they need to wrap up. Committee is concerned that Amazon can abuse access to data and third parties to launch competitors and bully.  My android phone (Google) gives me an Ad for Post Malone coming onto the Joe Rogan Experience on YouTube (Google).

## Rep Steube to Google
He gives a personal story of him googling something for himself and seeing that the best search result ("Gateway Pundit") was nowhere to be found. And then a week later, once Google finds out they are testifying, it pops to the top. So what has Google changed?

Coherent question, wow. Google responds with virtue signalling. Freedom of expression, thanks for the question, I don't know about this, etc etc. We will do our best to follow up.

Steube follows up and says that his campaign emails are getting marked as Spam on Gmail!!

## Aside - Dee is here, explaining the background a bit to him, eating

## Charman J Republican asks about conspiracy about siding with China, etc. Sort of Partisan

## Scanlon to Bezos
Dem, disses Republican, bit of a spat. So dumb. At least her question is good. Amazon buys competitors, cuts promotions, fires staffs, redirects traffic on their site. She has specific documents and companies. Bezos says he doesnt remember, it was 11 years ago. 

## to Zuck
Facebook is Over 90% of social media. Facebook CFO says they are going for a land grab. Bought competitors WhatsApp, Instagram. Emails documented saying that Facebook has so much money they could buy any competitor, "Well Played" and Zuckerberg says "Thanks." 

Zuckerberg claims those emails were a joke. Congressman says its a monopoly. 

## McBath to Bezos
Plays recording of previous Amazon employee / competitor? Oh it's the Diaper thing. They say Amazon partnered with a diaper company, started a competitor, delisted them, and shut them down. Over 500 communications to Amazon (including Bezos) and no meaningful response. Bezos says it's anecdotal and they would NEVER...

McBath responds saying he is missing the point and that there is a pattern with Amazon doing this with other companies. Bezos deflects, reiterating Ethos about rise from being a simple farm boy. 

## First Round Done. Back to the chair. Cicilline says to Bezos...
Amazon is 7x the market share of it's closest competitor (Shopify?). It's impossible for small sellers to compete with Amazon. Bezos says they want to HELP small sellers. Thats the center of the problem though. Cicilline refers to Internal documentation showing that Amazon refers to third parties as "internal competitors". Bezos doesnt deny

Cicilline quotes another person saying that Amazon strings third parties and partners along with small paychecks here and there. Then they shut them down. Compared to a drug dealer. Bezos disagrees.

Cicilline asks for examples of policy violations where third parties are listing on Amazon and then being undercut, as a result of Amazon requesting that data from them as partners. Bezos says we have a policy. Cicilline says the policy is violated routinely. Bezos says they are investigating. 


## Sensenbrenner says...
We don't need to change the anti-trust laws. They are fine. We need to enforce them though. Facebook acquiring Instagram and Whatsapp and others were signed off by the FTC. 

But we are back to where we were in 1984 with AT&T proving Congress can't enforce this stuff well.

### Bezos admits one of the things they are doing is not beneficial to consumers. Sort of missed it, seems important though. 

## Jayapal quotes Facebook email to Zuck
Internal emails saying that Facebook is shutting down and copying competitors and people that try to use their platform. How many competitors did you target? 5? 50? Zuckerberg seems to deny the premise. Zuckerberg says they would never threaten. Jayapal does another quoted internal email related to Facebook Camera competitor with Instagram. Insta felt FORCED to sell to Facebook because they would have been crushed otherwise. 

Jayapal wraps up saying that a dominant platform should never abuse their position to copy, acquire, or kill rivals. Facebook has threatened and dominated the market to gain more and more data and users and money which self-feeds back into the problem. Harms the economy and consumers. 

## Back to Mr. Buck to Bezos
Amazon uses proprietary data from third party companies and startups to copy, acquire, kill. Amazon made their own pop sockets and shoved the real ones way way down. Then once Pop Sockets paid $2m to Amazon they popped back up to the top. W T F

Also used venture capital meetings with Startups to get sensitive IP data, then make a competitor. This is especially troubling.  Quotes VocaLite startup which was meeting for VC funding and then killed by Amazon. 

Also quotes Amazon supply chains relying on forced communist chinese labor. Then simple yes/no question to all CEOs. Would you agree under oath that you will never use Slave/Forced labor? Tim Cook is a quick yes. Everyone else follows.

## Mr Baskin - Calls the CEOs Cyber Barons
Bezos first - Amazon is a gatekeeper to things like web streaming, e-commerce. Is currently wrapped up with HBO Max / Fire stick and won't approve until they get IP rights to media content?? Bezos says he doesn't know and hopefully they can come to an agreement. Baskin reiterates that yes this specific example is 2 decently sized companies negotiating but Amazon is still the strong arm. And there are millions of small companies that can not negotiate. 

Smart Homes example - Echo is normally priced way below cost, making competition impossible. They have enough money to burn and want to control the space. Also Ring. Mr. Baskin quotes another document with Amazon on record saying when they bought Ring they don't care about the tech they mostly want the market position and control. Alexa defaults to Amazon music, Amazon batteries and products, etc. Is Amazon training alexa to promote their own products. 

Bezos says yes but nothing wrong with that. Promoting your own products is normal.

## Gaetz to Pichai
Google took $15M from Chinese government to work on AI partnership. Also leaked memo describing a blacklist of "fringe" news sites. Quick aside from the author - https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-smart-glasses-going-offline-weeks-after-company-bought-by-google-1.5042010

Pichai goes back and forth regarding whether or not they manually or automatically handle things like blacklists, copyright striking, etc. Pichai agrees there is a manual element to the way in which sites are ranked and blacklisted. Gaetz says right wing sites are usually punished. Also anti-google articles. 

## Hank Johnson to Bezos
Amazon makes money when counterfeit goods are sold, and Amazon has a history of being loose and slow with enforcing anti-counterfeitting. Bezos responds he agrees, counterfeitting is a scourge, Amazon has a policy to investigate. Hank cuts him off saying that yes they have policies but they don't enforce it. They use knock off products to push off competitors. Pop Sockets for example, again. Bezos says he would rather lose money than a customer and he wants customers to trust Amazon. 

Hank says companies selling on their platform get buried unless they pay extra for ads.  Bezos says yeah thats how advertising works. 

### Brief Recess

## Demings to Zuckerberg
Quotes articles from 2012, 2013, and 2014 (Facebook was not a small company) where internal Facebook employees state they will be putting a large amount of pressure on Pinterest, MessageMe, etc. to shut down competitors so they can make their own version. 

## Demings to Cook
Same sort of question. Apple picks who succeeds and fails. Kids use tablets to learn, Apple dominates tablets, Apple shuts down children education apps unless they pay a large amount, including ones from governments from foreign countries. One from American private company kicked out. One from Saudi government that pays a lot of money stays. 

## Zuck just got accused of lying before congress about firing someone for political stance. Let's crack some beers

## Scanlon to Pichai
Why did Google purchase YouTube? Pichai says this was 2006 and he was not there, but he believes the company saw an oppurtunity. Cut off asking who made the decision, moving on...

Google is the top site for children's videos via YouTube. It is illegal to advertise to children but YouTube did it. Wtf? Pichai says we have good policies around this and we enforce it.

Scanlon says that they are STILL luring in investment from Hasbro and other childrens advertisers by claiming it is the largest children's advertisers. Pichai deflects.

Scanlon references Wall Street Journal report and audits about how content creators can control ads for kids. Says Google is being difficult around those rules

## Neguse to Bezos
Negus came up before but I missed his name and was maybe doing something. He is Vice-Chair from Colorado. He asks Bezos about the broad definition Bezos gave for the retail market size. Sure, Retail is 1% of all global retail, but 40% or more of e-commerce. Bezos 

Whoa mentions AWS startup partners. Does AWS use their partnership to build competing startup services? Online post from employee saying that they do this exact thing AND target the business's customers. Wow. Maybe it's time to shut down our Amazon partnership? 

Neguse brings up DefineCrowd allegations. Wow wow wow

## Sugar Security will no longer partner with Amazon

# Absolute Banger from Cicilline to Zuck
### Even with policies in place, Facebook can't control their own, DEADLY content. They have allowed and still allows dangerous, deadly videos (Fake Med News) to circulate to tens of millions before they remove it. Just the tip of the ice berg. Facebook has tens of thousands of white supremacy pages, etc. They get away with it because they have no competitors because they shut down or buy all their competitors. 

## Gaetz to Bezos
Southern Poverty Law Center controls who can be donated by Amazon Smile. They have blacklisted Dr. Ben Carson and many other conservative charities as hate speech. 

Bezos basically rephrases the whole question, acknowledges the system isn't perfect.

## Johnson from Georgia to Zuck about Instagram Acquisition
Facebook could "make more bold decisions on whether a competitor was friend or foe" via market research. Of course Zuck replies saying he doesn't know. Follow up is that Facebook bought Onavo as well for digital surveilance around their competitors. 

Facebook incentivized Teens to install the Facebook Research App for market research. This app was then thrown out of the app store. 

# ITS OVER
