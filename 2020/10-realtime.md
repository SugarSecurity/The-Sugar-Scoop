# Adapting from Pentesting to Real-Time Vulnerability Scanning

Organizations need to make the upgrade from disjointed penetration tests and MSSP services to a centralized and real-time solution. In the first half of 2020, [27 billion data records were exposed](https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/en/2020-mid-year-data-breach-quickview-report), including personal information, login credentials, financial data, PHI health records, and more. Covid-19 added to this, with [Trend Micro finding 9 million Covid-19-related threats](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/securing-the-pandemic-disrupted-workplace-trend-micro-2020-midyear-cybersecurity-report) between January to June 2020. Many cyber-criminals specifically target smaller businesses, which are seen as ‘low hanging fruit’ with fewer resources available to prevent a cyber-attack. 

When we look at the cyber-threat situation, it feels as if cybersecurity is out of control. Just as one vulnerability or entry point is closed, another opens. The SMB is always on the run, playing catch-up as cybercriminals forge ahead, innovating around cybercrime.

But help is here. Real-Time Vulnerability Detection is a technique that is managed on behalf of an SMB, giving them the tools to turn the tables on cybercrime. Discussed here, are some of the aspects of cyber-attacks that have led to the development of this innovation in threat detection.

# Vulnerabilities and threats gone mad

Understanding where the problems lie can help to decide what the risk levels are. In Q1 and Q2 of 2020, there were [2.5 times more security attacks](https://www.home.neustar/resources/whitepapers/cyber-threats-and-trends-report-2020-first-half) than in the same period in 2019. One of the problems in dealing with cyber-threats is that they are facilitated by the very technology that provides the modern business with innovative tools like online apps, etc. 

Cloud computing, and increasingly connected workplaces, mean that data is accessed from anywhere. This has been a real benefit during the Covid-19 pandemic where remote working is the new normal. But remote workers and contractors make it much harder to control which devices are used to access apps and data. ShadowIT, personal device use, and connectivity across insecure networks, etc., open digital doors for cybercriminals to enter networks. 

## The Costs of a Cyber-Attack on an SMB

SMBs have to deal with the multiple whammies of cybercrime. The SMB is a target because of a lack of IT resources to shore up defenses. And a cyber-attack can be very costly to deal with. A [survey by insurer Hiscox](https://www.hiscox.com/documents/2019-Hiscox-Cyber-Readiness-Report.pdf) found the average cost to an SMB affected by a cyber-attack is $200,000.  The report stating that: 

“where hackers formerly focused mainly on larger companies, small-and-medium -sized firms are now equally vulnerable.”

# What is a small business to do?

In an attempt to deal with the complexities of cybersecurity, cybersecurity professionals use a few techniques and approaches. These are typically based on the processes involved in prevention, detection, and response to cyberthreats. Two key examples are MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) and Penetration Tests (or Ethical Hackers). These both have major flaws that Sugar Security is working to address in a next-gen solution. 

## Five drawbacks of penetration testing:

Penetration testing (or “a pentest”) is carried out by cybersecurity professionals who test a system against known attack types. The testing looks for vulnerabilities in a network, application, or other compute function that cybercriminals could exploit. The pen testers attempt to act like a hacker looking for flaws in your technology and processes; pen testing usually looks for human errors too. A Pentest can be a useful way to find out inherent issues in an IT system. However, on its own, it has some drawbacks including:

### 1. Pentests quickly go out of date

The cyber-threat landscape is always changing as cybercriminals find new ways to attack a company. Fraud, such as Business Email Compromise (BEC), is highly complicated and includes both technological and human elements along with social engineering. As the landscape changes, previous Pentests become quickly outdated. It is a challenge to ensure that Pentest results reflect the changing cybersecurity threat landscape. To get benefit from a penetration test they need to be carried out regularly, which leads to drawback two.

### 2. Pentests can be expensive

Pentests require the expert knowledge of cybersecurity professionals who understand how to search for vulnerabilities. The process of pen testing also has a large manual element to it. This means it can be a costly process. Also, because pen tests need to be done regularly, costs soon stack up.

### 3. Pentests use old school vulnerability scanning

Traditional vulnerability scanning is often used to help find vulnerabilities during a Pentest. However, this method is limited. The scanning is not performed in real-time. As such, it is retrospective and misses new exploits. Vulnerability scans need to part of a real-time vulnerability detection kit to be effective in the ever-changing cyberthreat landscape.

### 4. Pentests don’t cover it all
Pentests are designed to look across your network and beyond but they can easily miss places where hackers can gain entry. Technology ecosystems are often based on cloud computing that allows employees and others to access apps and data using mobile devices and even IOT devices. ShadowIT is also a problem. This is where remote employees, off-site workers, and even those in the office use devices to access resources without the full knowledge of an IT team. Pentests may not cover all of the possible endpoints in such disparate ecosystems. 

### 5. Pentests can be inconsistent
Consistency and quality can be hard to guarantee. Pen testers are human beings and pen testing requires a high-degree of creativity – you must think like a hacker. Many factors must be considered, and the result is inconsistencies in quality. This also leaves gaps in the auditability of pen testing.
